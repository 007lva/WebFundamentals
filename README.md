Web Fundamentals <material-branch> [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/WebFundamentals.svg?branch=material-branch)](https://travis-ci.org/google/WebFundamentals)
================

Web Fundamentals is a technical documentation center for multi-device web
development.  Our goal is to build a resource for modern web developers
thatâ€™s as curated and thorough as developer.android.com or iOS Dev Center.

Content plan
------------
Content plan for Web Fundamentals is tracked through GitHub Issues and our [Site Structure + Content Inventory](http://goo.gl/nWDD0M) doc


Release status
--------------

The project was soft launched in late April with a formal v1 launch in June 2014.  We've now moved to a six-week rolling release cycle.

Project Structure
-----------------

This is a Jekyll build.

```
/appengine - the server to host the static content
/src - the documentation
  /_langs - the content in each language
    /en - the base language folder
      /getting-started - the getting started articles
      /multi-device-layouts - responsive design guide
      /introduction-to-media - the guide to using media
      /optimizing-performance - the perf articles
      /using-touch - managing touch
      /showcase - the case-studies
      ...etc...
    /<langcode> - overrides for that language, following the main path structure.
```

The site is generated in `/build`, but is never checked in.

1. Install the [Gulp CLI](http://gulpjs.com/)
    * `npm install -g gulp`

1. Get the [App Engine SDK](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads) and unzip into the google_appengine folder inside the project root. Add it to your path accordingly (in bash, `$ PATH=./google_appengine:$PATH`)

Running the site
================

Once you have all the dependencies installed go to the root of the checked out repo and type:

```
gulp
```

This will have Jekyll build the site, run a static server to listen on
port 7331 (which you can now reach at
[http://localhost:7331/web/](http://localhost:7331/web/)),
and watch for changes to site files. Every change will cause Jekyll to rebuild
the affected files.

If you want to build a single language then run this: `gulp --lang en`.

If you want to build a specific section then run this: `gulp --section shows`.

These can be combined: `gulp --lang en --section shows`

Learning More About Jekyll and Liquid Used

We have a styleguide which you can access at [http://localhost:7331/web/styleguide/](http://localhost:7331/web/styleguide/) that should get you up and running with a lot of the custom and useful info.
