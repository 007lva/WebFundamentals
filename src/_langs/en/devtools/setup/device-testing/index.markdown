One way or another you will need to try your site on various platforms,
spanning a number of device form factors.

There are a few different ways that you can view your site on different devices.
The one thing you need to keep in mind at all times is that nothing replaces
the real thing.

Simulators and emulators pretend to act like a real device, they are great for
exploring layouts locally, but they will be much faster (or slower) and wonâ€™t
always have the same behaviour as a real device.
