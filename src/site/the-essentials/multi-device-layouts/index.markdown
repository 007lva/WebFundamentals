introduction: 'Mobile-first web design is a goal for a development team to create sites, apps and experiences that scale well across all devices from mobile upwards. Many people conflate Mobile-first design with: "My users will predominantly use mobile" Instead Mobile-first design really means is "Mobile is my base experience". Mobile-first Web Design combines many techniques such as <a href="#">Responsive Web Design</a>, <a href="#">Progressive Enhancement</a> and <a href="#">Responsive Server</a> solutions to deliver experiences that work well across all form-factors.'
