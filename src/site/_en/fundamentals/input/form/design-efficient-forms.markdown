# TODO

## Minimize repeated actions and fields

## Show users how far along they are

## Use information you already have

## Provide visual calendars when selecting dates

Offer a visual calendar when selecting dates so visitors don't 
need to leave your site to check their calendar app. Prevent confusion by 
providing clear labeling for selecting start and end dates.

### Design efficient forms

Make sure your forms have no repeated actions, only as many fields as necessary, 
and take advantage of autofill. With multi-part forms, let your users know 
what's coming with a progress bar on top. Participants were intimidated by a 
multi-part form with a very complex initial step, but felt much more comfortable 
with a different, more straightforward form that clearly labeled each upcoming 
section. Participants also appreciated multi-part forms that prefilled 
information they had already entered, like their name and zip code.
