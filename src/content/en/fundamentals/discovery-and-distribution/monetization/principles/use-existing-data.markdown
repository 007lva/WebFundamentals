<p class="intro">
  Take advantage of information you already have, and/or use third-party payment services to make conversion as easy as possible.
</p>

For your registered users, remember and pre-fill their preferences. For new 
users, offer a third-party checkout service they may already use. Several 
retail sites in the study offered third-party payment services as an option, 
reducing purchasing friction for users of those services and allowing the site 
to prefill shipping info.
