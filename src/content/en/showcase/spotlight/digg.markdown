    good: |
      Digg's mobile presentation is really what one could call 'no fuzz'. They focus on their core experience, and while the layout is clean and simple, they got all of their basic functionality covered. The reduction makes the layout blazing fast, as well as the expandable Hamburger menu.
    bad: |
      Digg blocks user zooming which is a no-no nowadays. We'd love to see them add a [manifest](/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/simplified-app-installs) so that you can install the web app on Android, as well as [theme-color support](/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/browser-customization/theme-color).
