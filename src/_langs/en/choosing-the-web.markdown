introduction: "There are religious all-out battles between developers who embrace native applications and those that live and die for the openness of the web platform. Unfortunately, both sides are blinded in their beliefs and forget that choosing a platform needs to be a well researched and thoughtful decision that works for your business."

"Because it’s the right thing to do" is a just not a valid argument, unless we’re talking about ethics. So let’s help you figure out if, and when you should choose the web and walk through some of the unique user-facing abilities and features the open web platform provides.

{% include modules/toc.liquid %}

## Everywhere

Do you want your app to be everywhere? The web is everywhere. No, really. 
It’s available in almost every country of the world. It’s on TVs, PCs,
laptops, smartphones, smartwatches, tablets, refrigerators and toasters. OK,
maybe not toasters, but you get the point.

Building for the web means building across operating systems and devices.
While there are always certain browser and device differences plus UI
considerations, the same set of developers can handle the workload for all of
them, making the entire development cycle much less expensive. Hiring
individual talent for multiple platforms is much more risky and difficult,
and porting apps to multiple languages is a lengthy maintenance nightmare.

## Searchable

While native apps currently provide much more discoverability than the web
through custom App Stores, the web has an unbeatable ability to be found,
especially if content heavy: Provided your site is freely accessible, search
engines index all of your content within your app or site and make it all
available for their users. The more content and sub pages, the more doors open
for your visitors. A native app usually only has a single point of entry.

## Always up to date

By default, a web site or web app is always up to date. You are able to freely
choose how often you’d like to roll out individual updates and you can be
selective to whom you roll out certain new features. Updates happen
transparently to the user without the your visitors having to approve them,
making A/B testing new version trivial, but most importantly makes getting
100% of your users upgraded to the latest and hottest is an actual reality.
In stark contrast, native apps are bound to update delays and reviews that
often take up to two weeks depending on the vendor and when the update
arrives, it often requires the explicit agreement of the user.

It’s no coincidence that many news sites embrace the mobile web – If your app
demands to be fresh at all times for all of your users, choose the web.

## Instant load

While it is very difficult to build native apps that stream and lazy load
content and logic when needed, web apps and sites are naturally able to amend
their logic and content after the initial page load. Only the web platform
gives you the ability to create the impression of an instant load.

As web apps don’t have to be distributed in a single container, it’s perfectly
valid to preload the first visible content and make it available to the user
in less than a second, then lazy load the rest of it without the users
awareness. While performance during runtime is a different topic, the web
cannot be beaten if your goal is the immediate availability of your app.

## Independent

Corporate controlled App Stores, for all their advantages, come with strings
attached. Their offerings are controlled and shaped to match the culture of
the platform organization, thus excluding or severely restricting whole
categories of apps that are perfectly legal but not wanted. Other restrictions
apply when your app competes with a OS provided app or when your app wants to
use a different payment provider. In fact, the App Stores approval process is
often a black box and there is little room for discussion or dealing with
ambiguously rejected apps.

To be truly independent and free of fear of censorship, you have to embrace
the open web. If you are building an adult entertainment or file sharing app,
or prefer PayPal as payment method, go web.

## Ephemeral

Web apps and sites open with the help of a single click on a link, with the
implicit guarantee to the visitor that nothing terribly bad will happen.
Native apps in comparison need to be installed, a conscious process that
involves friction (click throughs, heavy download sizes, passwords), and often
constant risk assessment from the user.

The point of entry for web sites and apps is entirely effortless, and is not
only relevant for security considerations: What if your app belongs to a
category that is only used twice a year? Even if you get somebody to install
these types of apps, the stickyness of the home screen isn’t any help. Studies
show that there’s a clear upper limit for individual app usage per month, and
your app will likely be forgotten shortly after installing it. What if your
app was only a quick Google search away and instantly available when you need
it, gone when you don’t? That’s the concept of ephemeral apps.

Finally, install free also means risk free tryouts! Few native app stores
offer a way to trial an app before buying it, and the web allows exactly that:
Trial the app without any effort, then decide to keep it.

## Viral

Why are social games so much more popular than native games? There’s a
powerful messaging concept build into the web that make up its core: Hyperlink.
Social games take the concept of sharing links and the ability of multiple
entry points into your app and take it to the next level: Viral ways of
playing a game through nothing but link sharing!

Sure, you could share achievements out to Facebook or Twitter from an Xbox
game, but there’s a gap: How does the person who sees your share get into the
game? If it was built on the open web, all she would literally have to do is
click on the provided link.

What if those kinds of shareable interactions are actually part of the game or
functionality itself? Within a trivia app you could ask your followers on
Twitter, and without ever having seen, experienced or installed it, a click on
the link would get them answering and hooked, while we can likely all agree
that a click on a link that opens a page that promotes you walking into a
store to buy the game and put it into your console doesn’t have the same
impact.

## Long lasting

Native platform providers boast with the large new feature set they add every
year in comparison to the web platform, but they’re conveniently missing the
simple fact that they can do so only for the lack of standardization.
Corporate platforms come and go and a rarely lasting longer than a decade.

The web is built for the long haul. Through a painstakingly difficult
standardization effort at the W3C, the brightest minds in the world are making
sure that the platform you built upon is rock solid, consistent and well
supported. This means that the knowledge, code and talent foundation you build
up today in your teams will remain relevant in the future.

But much more importantly, it means that your users will probably be able to
use your site 20 years from now, even if you abandon its active development.
The same cannot be claimed for native platforms.
