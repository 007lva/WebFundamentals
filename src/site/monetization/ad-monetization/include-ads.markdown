## Build this sample app with ads

To see ads in action,
this guide walks you through the steps required to include ads
in the web starter kit using
[Google AdSense]({{site.baseurl}}/monetization/ad-monetization/how-ads-work.html#available-platforms).
Here's how the ads look on mobile and desktop
(check out the
[website](http://meggin.github.io/)
yourself and see how the ad content changes):

If you've never used the web starter kit,
follow [these instructions]({{site.baseurl}}/tools/setup/setup_kit.html)
to get set up.

## Submit your application

To submit an application for Google Adsense,
you must meet these
[requirements](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9724?hl=en&ref_topic=1319756):

* Be at least 18 years old and have a verified Google Account.
* Own a live website or other online content that complies with
[Google AdSense program policies](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182);
ads are hosted on this site.
* Have a postal address and a mailing address associated with your bank account
so you can receive payments.

To initiate the application process,
go to the [Google AdSense site](www.google.com/adsense).
This is the same site you will log into once your application's been approved.
Everything you need to know about getting your application approved
is covered in [this Google AdSense help topic](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/75109?hl=en&ref_topic=1319758). 

## Create ad units

[Responsive ad units](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3213689?hl=en&ref_topic=3641113)
allow you to control the size of the ads on your page,
in line with how you control the layout of the rest of your page across devices.

To create a responsive ad unit
(see also [Create an ad unit]https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6002575?rd=1() and
[https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3543893?hl=en&ref_topic=3641113](Create a responsive ad unit):

1. Visit the [My ads tab](https://www.google.com/adsense/app#myads-springboard).
2. Click <strong>+New ad unit</strong>.
3. Give your ad unit a unique name. This name appears in the ad code that's pasted into your site,
so be descriptive.
4. Select <strong>Responsive</a> from the Ad size drop-down.
5. Select <strong>Text & display ads</strong> from the Ad type drop-down.
6. Click <strong>Save and get code</strong>.
7. In the <strong>Ad code</strong> box that appears,
select the <strong>Smart sizing (recommended)</strong> option from the Mode drop-down.
This is the recommended mode and doesnâ€™t require you to make any changes to your ad code.

The ad code for the responsive ad unit looks something like this:
