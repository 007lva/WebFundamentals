title: "Set Up Your Dev Environment"
description: "Set up your development environment and quickly get up and running with the Web Starter Kit."
introduction: "Before you write any code, get the starter files and tools you need to create a responsive and performant site. The Web Starter Kit comes with a responsive boilerplate and a set of tools that let you code and test live changes across devices."
key-takeaways:
  starter-kit:
    - Decide how much UX you want to inherit from the Web Starter Kit: a responsive layout or just a very basic boilerplate?
    - The Web Starter Kit tools are optional, but if you don't have a solution yet to optimize your site, use them.
notes:
  command-line: 
    - Most of your interactions with the Google Web Starter Kit will be through the command line. Run commands in the Terminal app if youâ€™re on Mac, your shell in Linux, or <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin if you are on Windows</a>.

## Install prerequisites

Before installing the Google Web Starter Kit,
you will need the following:

* NodeJS v?
* npm v?(which comes bundles with Node)

{% include modules/remember.liquid title="Note" list=page.notes.command-line %}

You can check if you have Node and npm installed by typing:

$ node -v

$ npm -v

## Clone repository

You can use the Web Starter Kit by simply cloning the repository and building
on wha's included in the `app` directory:

git clone https://github.com/yeoman/web-starter-kit.git

$ cd web-starter-kit/app

## Install tooling

If you are using the kit tooling,
install the dependencies needed:

$ cd web-starter-kit

$ sudo npm install

I had to manually install gulp-- check with Addy on this:
Also, I ran npm install a second time after installing gulp,
to make sure I had gulp dependencies.
Need to re-run this to get cleanest path.

$ sudo npm install gulp-g

## Check out starter files 

Check out one of these starter files:

* <a href="">index.html</a> - the default starting point, slide-out menu
* <a href="">alt-layout.html</a> - if you prefer a horizontal nav
* <a href="">basic.html</a> - no layout

$ cd web-starter-kit/app

$ git add index.html

Question: what does Addy mean by checking out the starter file?
I've got a copy of everything in the build,
so it seems like everything is the default checkout.
True, if I want to modify the file,
I need to do a git add,
so that's what I've done here. 

## Build the project

Build the current project:

gulp

The build tool creates a new project directory: `web-starter-kit/dist`.

## Review the build output

Here's a snapshot of the project files in the `dist` directory:

## Stage the build output

From the web-starter-kit folder,
run the `gulp watch` tool to open up a local staged version of the project
(for more information on this tool, see <a href="">Track Code Changes).

The tool opens up the checked-out starter file, for example, `index.html`:
