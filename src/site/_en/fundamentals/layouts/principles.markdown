  tldr: 
    - Feature your primary calls-to-action in your most prominent site space.
    - A shorter menu with distinct categories is easier for mobile visitors to navigate.
    - Use your logo as a navigation button to return to the homepage.
    - Make sure promotions do not interfere with navigation and are clearly distinct from calls-to-action.

## Keep calls to action front and center

It can be easy for mobile users to miss menu items, so always put your key 
calls-to-action where you know users will see them. Study participants had the 
easiest time completing tasks on sites that clearly displayed primary 
calls-to-action in the main body of the site, with secondary tasks available 
through menus or below the fold. Your mobile calls-to-action will probably be 
different than on desktop, put yourself in your users' shoes when determining 
placement.

When users get to a site, they typically have a particular task in mind.  The 
site on the left only only offers users a Learn more button, while on the right, 
users are able to quickly get a quote, find a local agent, make a payment or log 
in.  

## Keep menus short and sweet

An extensive menu might work well for your desktop site, but mobile users won't 
have the patience to scroll through a long list of options to try and find what 
they want. Consider how you can present the fewest menu items possible.

Macy's, a major department store refined the product categories on its mobile 
site, presenting study participants with a shorter, more clearly-defined list 
than on desktop.

## Make it easy to get back to the home page

When mobile users navigate through your site, they want an easy way to get back 
to your initial homepage.  For example, they may want to get back to do another 
search or start a new browse experience.  

<figure>
  <img src="imgs/hpnav-hp-good-md.png" class="phone" alt="Clicking the logo returns users to the home page.">
  <figcaption>Clicking the logo in the upper right corner returns users to the home page.</figcaption>
</figure>

Users expect tapping the logo at the top of a page to take them back to the 
homepage, and study participants became frustrated if it didn't work.

## Don't let promotions steal the show

Promotions and ads can overshadow the content they're next to, and make it 
harder for users to accomplish tasks. Participants visiting one company's mobile 
site were distracted by a large promotional banner and missed the navigational 
buttons beneath it, making it hard for them to learn more about the company's 
offerings. 

<div class="clear g-wide--pull-1">
  <div class="g--half">
    <figure class="fluid">
      <img src="imgs/hpnav-promo-bad-md.png" alt="Door slams often annoy users and make using the site a pain.">
      <figcaption>Interstitials (sometimes called door slams) often annoy users and make using the site a pain.</figcaption>

      <figcaption>Promotions should be easily dismissable and not distract from the experience.</figcaption>
      </figure>
  </div>
</div>

For app promotions, use easily dismissible banners, which were preferred by 
study participants; as opposed to large interstitials (also known as door 
slams).  

## Keep your user in a single browser window

Switching between windows on a smartphone can be troublesome, and raises the 
risk that visitors might not find their way back to your site. Try to keep users 
in one place by avoiding calls-to-action that launch new windows.

  <figcaption>Macy's keeps their users on their site by providing coupons.</figcaption>
</figure>

For example, if you accept coupons, consider offering these on your site to 
avoid users opening new windows to search elsewhere.  Consider other ways that 
might cause a user to to look outside your site and provide easy to use features 
to keep them on your site.
