TBD. Main doc: Main doc for this stuff: developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/network

TBD. Include:

** Which resource had the slowest time to first byte (latency)? Research latency a little bit.

** Which resource took the longest time to load (duration)? Research duration a little bit.

** Kind of like the idea of a section: Whatâ€™s the difference between measuring latency and duration?

** How much time was spent in various network phases for a particular resource?

** How to distinguish performance by resource type. DevTools color-coding for resource types in Network panel is cool. I want to raise this up a bit, but not in love with first go at title.

** Determine who initiated a network request
