  layout-issues:
    - Don't over-complicate your CSS. Use less CSS and keep your CSS selectors simple.
    - Avoid layout as much as possible. Choose CSS that doesn't trigger layout at all.
    - Don't write JavaScript that forces your browser to recalculate layout. Separate read and write functions, and read first.
    - The Chrome DevTools Timeline shows you when you've forced the browser to recalculate layout. See lots of warnings? Layout thrashing forces the browser to recalculate layout over and over again.
    - Painting can take up more time than any other rendering activity. Watch out for paint bottlenecks.

Layout (or reflow in Firefox) is the process by which the browser calculates the positions and sizes of all the elements on a page. The web’s layout model means that one element can affect others; for example, the width of the `<body>` element typically affects its children’s widths and so on all the way up and down the tree. The process can be quite involved for the browser.

Learn about four key layout problems: a brief introduction on what causes them, the tools available to track them down, some quick fixes, and links off to more detailed tutorials on how to fix them. Know about these problems already and want to dive deeper into fixes? See [Improve Rendering Performance](https://web-central.appspot.com/web/tools/profile-performance/rendering-tools/index).

## Problem 1: Complicated CSS

Style changes are costly, especially if those changes affect more than one element in the DOM. Any time you apply styles to an element, the browser has to figure out the impact on all related elements, recalculate the layout, and repaint.

{% include modules/related_guides.liquid inline=true list=page.related-guides.style %}

### Tool

Know which CSS properties cost more in terms of rendering performance than others. [CSS Triggers](http://csstriggers.com/) lets you filter by CSS property, shows whether each CSS property affects layout, paint, or composite, and provides a detailed description of that property's impact on renderng performance:

## Problem 2: Forced synchronous layouts

Normally, Chrome performs layouts "lazily" in response to CSS or DOM updates from your application. This allows Chrome to batch style and layout changes rather than reacting to each on demand. However, your JavaScript can force Chrome to perform a layout immediately and synchronously by querying the value of certain layout-dependent element properties such as `element.offsetWidth`.

A general rule of thumb: if you ask for a geometric value back from the DOM before a frame is complete, you are going to find yourself with forced synchronous layouts. These so called "forced synchronous layouts" can be a big performance bottleneck if repeated frequently or performed for large DOM trees. 

Both Wilson Page and Paul Lewis recommend separating reading styles from changing styles, and reading styles first. They also recommend using `requestAnimationFrame` to ensure that your JavaScript runs at the start of a frame. When visual changes are happening on screen you want to do your work at the right time for the browser, which is right at the start of the frame.

See also 
[Optimize JavaScript Execution](https://web-central.appspot.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/optimize-javascript-execution).

Wilson Page's blog post on  provides quick fixes to forced synchronous layouts, including batching the DOM reads and DOM writes together so that the layout is calculated just once. This post also

### Tool

The Chrome DevTools Timeline identifies when your application causes a forced asynchronous layout and marks such records with yellow warning icon: ![Forced synchronous layout warning](imgs/image25.png)). 

![Timeline with forced synchronous layout warning](imgs/forced_layout.png)

Learning to use the Timeline tool effectively requires some practice. For detailed information on how to use the Timeline tool, see [Analyze Rendering Performance](https://web-central.appspot.com/web/tools/profile-performance/rendering-tools/analyze-runtime?hl=en).

## Problem 3: Layout thrashing

Layout thrashing is a forced-synchronous layout broken-record. JavaScript writes and then reads from the DOM multiple times, forcing the browser to re-calculate layout over and over again. The most common cause of layout thrashing: a loop that puts the browser into a read-write-read-write cycle:

<pre>
function resizeAllParagraphsToMatchBlockWidth() {

  // Puts the browser into a read-write-read-write cycle.
  for (var i = 0; i < paragraphs.length; i++) {
    paragraphs[i].style.width = box.offsetWidth + 'px';
  }
}
</pre>

### Tool

Layout thrashing is easy to spot using a Timeline recording. Multiple forced synchronous warnings that are pattern-like is a strong signal:

![Layout thrashing](layout-thrashing/tbd.png)

### Fixes

The same fixes for individual forced synchronous layous apply to layout thrashing, but you can save yourself a lot of time using this fix:

## Problem 4: Long paint times

Paint is the process of filling in pixels and is often the most costly part of the rendering process. Trigger layout, and you trigger paint, because the browser has to create pixels for the new geometry.

If you've noticed that your page is janky in any way -- for example, scrolling isn't smooth -- then more likely than not you've got paint problems.

The first step to fixing paint problems is identifying them. Paul Irish's post [Profiling Long Paint Times with DevTools Continuous Painting Mode](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2013/02/Profiling-Long-Paint-Times-with-DevTools-Continuous-Painting-Mode), explains how to use Chrome DevTools to track paint issues.

Once you've identified the problems, you can start to fix them. Paul Lewis' article, [Simplify paint complexity and reduce paint areas](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/simplify-paint-complexity-and-reduce-paint-areas?hl=en), describes in detail what you can do to avoid too much paint. 

The main gist of both of these articles is summarized here.

### Tool

Want to know how long painting takes or how often painting occurs? Enable the Paint profile in the Chrome DevTools Timeline. Record interaction with your page, and check to see if most of the rendering time is spent painting. If it is, you've got paint problems.

![Long paint times in timeline recording](imgs/long-paint.png)

Diagnose the paint problems further by enabling <strong>Show paint rectangles</strong> and <strong>Enable continuous page repainting</strong> in the Timeline Rendering settings:

![Chrome DevTools rendering settings](imgs/rendering-settings.png)

Seeing the regions where Chrome paints helps diagnose and ultimately [avoid unnecessary paints](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/unnecessary-paints/) on a page. You can also use this to [study painting behaviors](http://www.paulirish.com/2011/viewing-chromes-paint-cycle/) just by hovering over links, popups, or some content which dynamically updates.

When you enable continuous paint mode, the page continuously repaints, showing a counter of how much painting work is happening. You can hide elements and mutate styles, watching the counter, in order to figure out what is slow.
