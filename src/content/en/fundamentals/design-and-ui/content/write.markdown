The US government writing guide at <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/writing-for-the-web.html">usability.gov</a> summarizes what people want from writing on the web:

> When writing for the web, using plain language allows users to find what they need, understand what they have found, and then use it to meet their needs.
>
> It should also be actionable, findable, and shareable.


## How people read

[Research from Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/concise-scannable-and-objective-how-to-write-for-the-web/) shows that:

* People don't read web pages, they scan.

* On average, [people only read 20–28% of web page content](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/).

* Interactive [users read very few words](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/) on most web pages, because they're impatient and already have their mouse-finger itching to move to the next page.

* People won’t read web content unless the text is clear, the words and sentences are simple, and the information is easy to understand.
* A study of five different writing styles found that a sample Web site scored 58% higher in measured usability when it was written concisely, 47% higher when the text was scannable, and 27% higher when it was written in an objective style.

* Reading from computer screens is about 25% slower than reading from paper.

* Be succinct: write no more than 50% of the text you would have used in a hardcopy publication.

[The BBC's Journalism Academy](http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/journalism/article/art20130702112133610) advises writers to focus on the subject at hand:

> When writing for the web, tell the story upfront. For it to work across all possible platforms and devices, it needs to be told in essence in the first four paragraphs, around 70 words:
>
> • Make sure the crux of the story is in the introduction — not in paragraph four
>
> • Check that paragraphs are clear, balanced, provide context, and are effectively self-standing
>
> • Double-check that the headline matches the story.

The [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk) guidelines tell a similar story:

> Don’t publish everything you can online. Publish only what someone needs to know so they can complete their task. Nothing more.
>
> People don’t usually read text unless they want information. When you write for the web, start with the same question every time: what does the user want to know?
>
> Meeting that need means being:
>
> • specific
>
> • informative
>
> • clear and to the point

They also point out that from their research:

> • 80% of people preferred sentences written in clear English — and the more complex the issue, the greater that preference (e.g., 97% preferred "among other things" over the Latin "inter alia").
>
> • The more educated the person and the more specialist their knowledge, the greater their preference for plain English.

The pared-down approach to writing is particularly important for readers on mobile devices, and is crucial when creating content for low-cost phones with small viewports that require more scrolling and may have lower quality displays and less responsive screens. A minimalist attitude will also make your content easier to localize and internationalize.

Most of the next billion users coming online will have cheap devices, will not want to spend their data plans on navigating long-winded content, and may not be reading in their first language.

The bottom line:

* Keep it simple
* Reduce clutter
* Get to the point
