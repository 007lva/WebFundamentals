TBD. Mainly covering Frames mode in doc: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/timeline#frames-mode

Note: There's a doc, analyzing rendering problems in evaluate performance section that should intro this. We may want to combine everything into one place, but can decide later depending on how the content comes together.

We recommend learning as much as you can about rendering optimization. If you are completely unfamiliar with rendering performance in general, try Udacity's [Browser Rendering Optimization course](https://www.udacity.com/course/browser-rendering-optimization--ud860). Need a refresher? Check out the [Rendering Performance fundamentals](fundamentals/performance/rendering/index)
