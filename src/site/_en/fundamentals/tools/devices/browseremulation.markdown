When you donâ€™t have a particular device, or want to do a spot check on something,
the best option is to emulate the device right inside your browser.

These are great for testing the responsiveness of your site, but they do not
emulate differences in API and CSS support, so you will still need to test on
browsers running on the devices to be certain that everything is as expected.

## Chrome DevTools Emulation

Chrome DevTools has a Device emulation tool which will create a viewport with the right width and height to match a selected device and account for the screen density.

You can activate device emulation by following these four steps:

1. With Chrome DevTools open, click the arrow icon with three horizontal lines
2. Click the mobile device in the top left.
3. Select the 'emulation' tab at the bottom.
4. Then select the device you want to test against from the drop down.

## FireFox Responsive View

Firefox has a responsive design mode which encourages you stop thinking in terms
of specific devices and instead explore how your design changes at common screen
sizes or your own size by dragging the edges.

To use the responsive view, open the developer tools in Firefox and click the
icon illustrated in step 1 below and use the handles at the side of the web page
to resize it, illustrated in step 2.

## IE Device Emulation

IE11 has a feature where you can change the viewport to match a Window Phone as
well as test how your site on older versions of IE.

To change the emulated browser do the following:

1. Select the emulation tab.
2. Click the drop down labelled **Browser profile** and select your device.
