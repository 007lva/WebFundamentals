title: "Multi-Device Tools"
description: "Not all devices are equal when it comes to CPU, GPU, and battery life. Often mobile devices are underpowered and subject to slow or unreliable connections. Adjust your development workflow to think in terms of finite resources. Device capabilities and network availability vary greatly. Choose tools that help you build a site that is responsive and performant on all devices. The Web Starter Kit provides the scaffolding, tools, and style guidelines that get you most of the way."
