## Check scorecards

Want to know if your site and ads are as good as they can be?
Check your site's general health, multiple-screen support, and ads revenue potential
using the [Google AdSense scorecards](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3006004?).

Each scorecard reports any improvements that need to be made,
and helps you make the necessary fixes.
Address any items that you see with a red or yellow exclamation mark,
as fixing them may help to increase your traffic and/or revenue.

These sample scorecards show green check marks, indicating a healthy site,
with maximized ads revenue potential.

## Run performance reports

[Google AdSense performance reports](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/160562?hl=en&ref_topic=19209)
provide more insight into not just how much you're earning,
but what impacts those earnings.

We recommend using these reports to maximize your ads revenue on multiple devices:

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Report</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td data-th="Report"><a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3540509?hl=en&ref_topic=3721751">Creative sizes</a></td>
      <td data-th="Description">Shows you the size of displayed ads served on your site; use this report to understand trends in ad sizing when using responsive ads.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td data-th="Report"><a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/23168?hl=en">Targeting types</a></td>
      <td data-th="Description">Reports how ads are being targeted to your site; specifically compares the percentage of ads targeting your site's content compared to the percentage of ads targeting user-interests.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td data-th="Report"><a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3373004?hl=en&ref_topic=3721751">Platforms</a></td>
      <td data-th="Description">Shows which devices your ad units were viewed on, for example, on desktop or mobile. 
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
