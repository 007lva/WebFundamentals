<p class="intro">
  Service workers provide web pages with capabilities that make them more like 
  native apps. Here are a list of characteristics and apps or sites that 
  demonstrate their use.

*Responsiveness*&mdash;What if you could build a web page that took voice recordings? Google's sample app called Voice Memos does exactly that. For a web-based memo app a slow network would mean slow playback. Voice Memos solves this by caching memos on the device. The code is available on GitHub.

*Offline access*&mdash;The Guitar Tuner app by Paul Lewis doesn't need a server to run, but how do you keep it on the device? A service worker stores the app's resources so that reopening doesn't require communicating with a server. The code is available on GitHub. 

*Engagement*&mdash;
