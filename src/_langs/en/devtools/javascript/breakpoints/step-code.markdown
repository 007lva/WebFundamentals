{% wrap content %}

TBD. Content to include (but rework and have more directed titles):

** Intro to the sources panel and how to access it-- this might also belong better in the intro to the card, but I’ve kept it here for now.

** Execution control

** Interact with paused breakouts-- Make sure to cover basic interaction as well as the different pauses. Also cover long resume.

** Call Stack panel

** Live edit your JavaScript and the Console drawer-- Basically introduce live editing, and introduce seeing results in the console drawer; then link off to console and command line docs.

** From Paul Irish (advanced): “Debugging Asynchronous program flow”. Given this is advanced, it is outside the scope of this doc, but we should cross-reference it (I’ve a place-holder for debugging asynchronous code.
