introduction: "Content is the most important aspect of any site. So letâ€™s design for the content and not let the design dictate the content. In this guide, we identify the content we need first, create a page structure based on this content, and then present the page in a simple linear layout that works well on narrow and wide viewports."

{% wrap content %}

{% include modules/toc.liquid %}

## Create the page structure

We have identified we need:

1.  An area that describes at a high-level our product "Smiles"
2.  A form to collect information from users who are interested in our product
3.  An in depth description and video
4.  Images of the product in action
5.  A data table with information to back the claims up

{% include modules/takeaway.liquid list=page.key-takeaways.content-critical %}

We have also come up with a rough information architecture and layout for both the narrow and wide viewports.

<div class="demo">
  <img class="g-wide--1 g-medium--half" src="images/narrowviewport.jpg" alt="Narrow Viewport IA"><img  class="g-wide--3 g-wide--last g-medium--half g--last" src="images/wideviewport.jpg" alt="Wide Viewport IA">
</div>

This can be converted easily in to the rough sections of a skeleton page that 
we will use for the rest of this project.

{% include_code _code/addstructure.html structure %}

## Add content to the page

The basic structure of the site is complete.
We know the sections we need, the content to display in those sections,
and where to position it in the overall information architecture.
We can now start to build out the site.

{% include modules/remember.liquid title="Note" list=page.notes.styling %}

### Create the headline and form

The headline and request-a-demonstration form are the critical components of our page.
These must be presented to the user immediately.

Adding the header is just a simple set of list items.

{% include_code _code/addcontent.html headline %}

We need to also fill out the form.  It will be a simple form that collects the
 users' names, their phone number, and a good time to call them back.

All forms should have labels and placeholders to make it easy for users to focus
elements, understand what is supposed to go in them, and to also help
accessibility tools understand the structure of the form.  The name attribute
not only sends the form value to the server, it is also used to give important
hints to the browser about how to automatically fill in the form for the user.

We will add semantic types to make it quick and simple for users to be able to
enter content on a mobile device.  For example, when entering a telephone number,
the user should just see a dial pad.

{% include_code _code/withform.html form %}

<div class="related-items">
<div class="related-items">
<div class="container">
<div markdown='1' class="g-wide--push-1 g-medium--push-1">

### Create the Video and Information section

The Video and Information section of content will contain a little more depth.
It will  have a bulleted list of features of our products and will also contain
a video placeholder that shows our product working for the user.

{% include_code _code/addcontent.html section1 %}

Videos are often used to describe content in a more interactive manner and are
frequently used to show a demonstration of a product or a concept.  

By following the best practices, you can easily integrate video in to your site:

*  Add a `controls` attribute to make it easy for people to play the video.
*  Add a `poster` image to give people a preview of the content.
*  Add multiple `<source>` elements based on supported video formats.
*  Add fall-back text to let people download the video if they can't play it in the window.

{% include_code _code/addvideo.html video html %}

<div class="related-items">
<div class="related-items">
<div class="container">
<div markdown='1' class="g-wide--push-1 g-medium--push-1">

### Create the Images Section

Sites without images can be a little boring.  There are two types of images:

*  Content images &mdash; Images that are in-line in the document and are used 
   to convey extra information about the content.
*  Stylistic images &mdash; images are often used to make the site look 
   better, often these are background images, patterns and gradients.  We will
   cover this in the [next article]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.article.next.url}}).

The Images section is a collection of content images that we will use that
demonstrate four different scenarios where our product can be used.

{% include_code _code/addcontent.html section2 %}

Content images are images that are critical to conveying the meaning of the
page. Think of it as images that are used in newspaper articles.

{% include_code _code/addimages.html images html %}

The images in this case our set to scale to 100% of the width of the screen.
This works well on  mobile devices, but less well on desktop.  We will manage
this in the responsive design section.

<div class="related-items">
<div class="related-items">
<div class="container">
<div markdown='1' class="g-wide--push-1 g-medium--push-1">

### Add the Tabulated Data Section

The final section is a simple table that is used to show specific product stats
about the product.

Tables should only be used for tabular data, i.e, matrices of information.

{% include_code _code/addcontent.html section3 %}

### Add a Footer

Most sites need a footer to display content such as Terms and Conditions,
disclaimers and other content that is not meant to be in the main navigation nor in the main content area of the page.  

In our site we will just link to Terms and Conditions, a Contact page and 
our social media profiles.

{% include_code _code/addcontent.html footer %}

## Summary

We have created the outline of the site and we have identified all the main 
structural elements.  We have also made sure that we have all the relevant 
content ready and in-place to satisfy our business needs.  

<div class="clear">
  <img class="g-wide--2 g-medium--half" src="images/content.png" alt="Content" style="max-width: 100%;">
  <img  class="g-wide--2 g-wide--last g-medium--half g--last" src="images/narrowsite.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;">
</div>

You will notice that the page looks terrible right now. That is intentional.
Content is the most important aspect of any site and we needed to make sure we
have a good solid information architecture and density.  This guide has given
us an excellent base to build upon, but we will get to a good position quickly
in our next guide.
