TBD. Profiling JavaScript performance doc: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/cpu-profiling

TBD. Includes Profiling JavaScript execution:

** General execution profiles panel
** Execution profilne over time using timelines and flame chart 

TBD. Measuring how long something takes using console.time()

TBD. Profiling CPU using CPU profiler. CPU profiler shows where execution time is spent in your page’s JavaScript Controlling the CPU profiler section currently in Debugging Your JavaScrip: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console#controlling-the-cpu-profiler 

TBD. Hidden classes

TBD. Demo: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/demos/memory/example5

TBD. Info: https://developers.google.com/v8/design

Question: Is there anything developer needs to do to use hidden classes or is it entirely up to the compiler to automatically do this? I know V8 does this, but I’m wondering if there’s anything developer can do to optimize for v8?
