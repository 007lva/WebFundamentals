<p class="intro">
  The push and notifications API's let you notify users the same way a 
  native app would. Just like native notifications, some ways of using 
  them are better than others.

In 2015, a [Google case study](#TODO) found 
that when prompted to download and install the Google+ app 9% of users 
did so. That's an impressive click-through rate, or it would be if we 
were talking about online ads. The same study found that 69% of users 
both left the page that triggered the prompt and ignored the 
invite to install Google+.
