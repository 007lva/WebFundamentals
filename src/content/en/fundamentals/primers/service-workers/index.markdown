<p class="intro">
  Service workers have been described as &ldquo;programmable network
  proxies&rdquo; and &ldquo;background workers&rdquo;. To be more specific, a 
  service worker is a script run by a browser in the background that proxies and 
  caches network interactions.</p>

Because a service worker is separate from the page that loaded it, it doesn't 
need a web page or user interactions. A service worker terminates when it's not 
being used and reactivates again when it's needed. A single service worker can 
support more than one web page.
