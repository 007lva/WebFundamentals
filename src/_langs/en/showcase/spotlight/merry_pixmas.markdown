introduction: Christmas fun with 3D CSS Transforms.
pros: |
  A nice Christmas-themed demo that works well across desktop and mobile. It even comes with brand new theme color support, and a Web manifest for a homescreen experience that launches full screen.

  Pro tip: Shake your phone to make it snow!
cons: |
  Even though I realize it is a demo, a few specificed cache headers on assets and non-render-blocking JavaScript could have improved the perceived load time quite a bit.
