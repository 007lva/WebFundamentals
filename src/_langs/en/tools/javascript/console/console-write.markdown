{% wrap content %}

TBD. Specified parts of doc: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console

TBD. Includes:

** Writing to the Console-- Make sure to cover Styling console output with CSS as part of the writing bit, as they seem to be better grouped together.

** Organizing Console output-- Includes “Filtering Console output” and “Grouping output” content.

** Errors and Warnings

** Assertions

** String substitution and formatting

TBD. Not sure what to do with “Formatting DOM elements as JavaScript objects”. It seems a little bit out of place in this page, and yet it’s not enough to get it’s own page. Gonna wait to figure this out while writing the doc.
