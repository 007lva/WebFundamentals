<p class="intro">
  Google and AnswerLab undertook an intensive research study examining how a range of users interacted with a diverse set of mobile sites.  The goal, to answer the question: what makes a good mobile site?
</p>

The results uncovered a set of design principles, which were grouped into 
five sections: 

* Site-wide Design Considerations
* Home Page &  Navigation 
* Site Search 
* Commerce & Conversions 
* Form Entry

The common thread in all sections is that mobile users tend to be very 
goal-oriented - they expect to be able to get what they need from a mobile 
site easily, immediately, and on their own terms. 

## About the study methodology

* The study was held through 119 hour-long in-person usability sessions with 
  participants in Chicago and San Francisco.
* Participants were asked to perform key tasks on their own phones. Both Android 
  and iOS users were included.
* For each site, we asked the participants to complete a conversion-focused task 
  like making a purchase, booking a reservation or researching plans/prices. The 
  participants voiced their thoughts aloud as they conducted their tasks and 
  then rated their experience with each site.
* Researchers also provided ratings based on site experience and task success, 
  and logged errors/site issues by severity.
