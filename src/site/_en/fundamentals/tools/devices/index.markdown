One way or another you will need to test your site across different platforms,
spanning device form factors.

There are a few different ways that you can test your site for different devices.
The one thing you need to keep in mind at all times is that nothing replaces the real thing.

Simulators and emulators pretend to act like a real device, they are great for
testing locally, but they will be much faster (or slower) and wonâ€™t always have
the same behaviour as a real device.
