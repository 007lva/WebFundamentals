To answer this question, Google and AnswerLab undertook a 
[research study](http://www.google.com/think/multiscreen/whitepaper-sitedesign.html?utm_source=web-fundamentals&utm_term=chrome&utm_content=ux-landing&utm_campaign=web-fundamentals) 
examining how a range of users interacted with a diverse group of mobile sites. 
The results uncovered 24 mobile site design principles, which we've grouped into 
five sections: 

### Site-wide design considerations
* [Use responsive design patters to build your site](/web/fundamentals/layouts/)
* [Don't make users pinch-to-zoom](/web/fundamentals/layouts/rwd-fundamentals/size-content-to-the-viewport.html)
* [Make product images expandable](/web/fundamentals/media/images/images-in-markup.html#make-product-images-expandable)
* [Be clear why you need a user's location](/web/fundamentals/device-access/user-location/user-consent.html#always-request-access-to-location-on-a-user-gesture)
* [Keep your users in a single browser window](/web/fundamentals/layouts/principles.html#keep-your-user-in-a-single-browser-window)

### Home page and navigation
* [Keep calls to action front and center](/web/fundamentals/layouts/principles.html#keep-calls-to-action-front-and-center)
* [Choose the simplest input method for each task](/web/fundamentals/layouts/principles.html#keep-menus-short-and-sweet)
* [Make it easy to get back to the home page](/web/fundamentals/layouts/principles.html#make-it-easy-to-get-back-to-the-home-page)
* [Don't let promotions steal the show](/web/fundamentals/layouts/principles.html#dont-let-promotions-steal-the-show)

### Optimizing form entry
* [Streamline information entry](/web/fundamentals/input/form/choose-the-best-input-type.html)
* [Choose the simplest input method for each task](/web/fundamentals/input/form/choose-the-best-input-type.html#offer-suggestions-during-input-with-datalist)
* [Provide visual calendars when selecting dates](/web/fundamentals/input/form/design-efficient-forms.html#provide-visual-calendars-when-selecting-dates)
* [Minimize form errors with labeling and real-time validation](/web/fundamentals/input/form/provide-real-time-validation.html)
* [Design efficient forms](/web/fundamentals/input/form/design-efficient-forms.html)

### Site search
* [Make site search visible](/web/fundamentals/ux/site-search.html#make-site-search-visible)
* [Ensure site search results are relevant](/web/fundamentals/ux/site-search.html#ensure-site-search-results-are-relevant)
* [Implement filters to narrow results](/web/fundamentals/ux/site-search.html#implement-filters-to-narrow-results)
* [Guide users to better site search results](/web/fundamentals/ux/site-search.html#guide-users-to-better-site-search-results)

### Commerce and conversions
* [Let users explore before they commit](/web/fundamentals/monetization/principles.html#let-users-explore-before-they-commit)
* [Let users purchase as a guest](/web/fundamentals/monetization/principles.html#let-users-explore-before-they-commit)
* [Make it easy to finish on another device](/web/fundamentals/monetization/principles.html#make-it-easy-to-finish-on-another-device)
* [Use existing information to maximize convenience](/web/fundamentals/monetization/principles.html#use-existing-information-to-maximize-convenience)
* [Use click-to-call buttons for complex tasks](/web/fundamentals/device-access/click-to-call/click-to-call.html)



### The common thread

The common thread in all sections is that mobile users tend to be very 
goal-oriented - they expect to be able to get what they need from a mobile site 
easily, immediately, and on their own terms. Ensure success by designing with 
their context and needs in mind without sacrificing richness of content.


## About the study methodology

* The study was held through 119 hour-long in-person usability sessions with 
  participants in Chicago and San Francisco.
* Participants were asked to perform key tasks on their own phones. Both Android 
  and iOS users were included.
* For each site, we asked the participants to complete a conversion-focused task 
  like making a purchase, booking a reservation or researching plans/prices. The 
  participants voiced their thoughts aloud as they conducted their tasks and 
  then rated their experience with each site.
* Researchers also provided ratings based on site experience and task success, 
  and logged errors/site issues by severity.
