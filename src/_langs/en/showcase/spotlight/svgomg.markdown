<h3>What we like</h3>

<p>Built by our own <a href="http://jakearchibald.com/">Jake Archibald</a>, SVGOMG is an almost perfect example of a fully responsive and capable tool written with web technologies. It features a beautiful Material Design look, and the transitions are smooth on mobile.</p>

<h3>Possible improvements</h3>

<p>The only real nitpick we'd have to offer is that the initial UX is confusing due to the main UI missing. Other than that, job well done!</p>
