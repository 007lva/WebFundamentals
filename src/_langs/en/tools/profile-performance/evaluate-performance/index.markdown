TBD. Great doc for improving JavaScript performance: http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/06/12/javascript-profiling-chrome-developer-tools/ 

TBD. Cross-reference Pagespeed. This is more about testing in production, not live, so this is more a cross-reference.

TBD. Doc: developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/timeline. The doc describes performance profiling with Timeline as the best place to start investigating perceived performance issues, so seems like this might be at the top.
