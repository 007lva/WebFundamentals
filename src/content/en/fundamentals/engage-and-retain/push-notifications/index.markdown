<p class="intro">
  Push messaging is a feature that lets you engage with users in the same way as a native app, by providing timely and customized content outside the context of the web page, such as breaking news, site updates, or other information of interest.

In 2015, a [Google case study](#TODO) found 
that when prompted to download and install the Google+ app 9% of users 
did so. That's an impressive click-through rate, or it would be if we 
were talking about online ads. The same study found that 69% of users 
both left the page that triggered the prompt and ignored the 
invite to install Google+.
