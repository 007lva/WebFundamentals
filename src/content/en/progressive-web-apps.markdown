### What is a Progressive Web App?

Progressive Web Apps are experiences that combine the best of the web and 
the best of apps. They are useful to users from the very first visit in 
a browser tab, no install required. As the user progressively builds 
a relationship with the App over time, it becomes more and more 
powerful; loading quickly, even on flaky networks, sending relevant 
push notifications, having an icon on the homescreen and loading as 
top-level, fullscreen experiences.

#### Progressive Web Apps are:

* **Progressive** - Work for every user, regardless of browser choice because they’re built with progressive enhancement as a core tenant.
* **Responsive**  - Fit any form factor, desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever is next.
* **Connectivity independent** - Enhanced with Service Workers to work offline or on low quality networks.
* **App-like** - Use the App Shell model to provide app style navigations & interactions.
* **Fresh** - Always up-to-date thanks to the Service Worker update process.
* **Safe** - Served via TLS to prevent snooping and ensure content hasn’t been tampered with.
* **Discoverable** - Are identifiable as “applications” thanks to W3C Manifests and Service Worker registration scope allowing search engines to find them.
* **Re-engageable** - Makes re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.
* **Installable** - Allows users to “keep” apps they find most useful on their home screen without the hassle of an app store.
* **Linkable** - Zero-friction, zero-install, and easy to share, the social power of the URL still matters.
