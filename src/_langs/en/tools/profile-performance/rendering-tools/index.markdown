TBD. Mainly covering Frames mode in doc: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/timeline#frames-mode

Note: There's a doc, analyzing rendering problems in evaluate performance section that should intro this. We may want to combine everything into one place, but can decide later depending on how the content comes together.
