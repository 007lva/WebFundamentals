# Contributing: submitting patches and tutorials

## Submitting a code patch or studio/playground sample

### Contributor License Agreements

This section only applies if you are submitting a patch. The CLA mentioned below does not apply if you are giving us a brand new article or tutorial.

We'd love to accept your code patches! However, before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement.

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then sign an [individual CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html).
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work to HTML5Rocks.com, then sign a [corporate CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html).

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll add you to the official list of contributors and be able to accept your patches.

1. Sign the contributors license agreement above.
2. Decide which code you want to submit. A submission should be a set of changes that addresses one issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Google/WebFoundations/issues). Please don't mix more than one logical change per submittal, because it makes the history hard to follow. If you want to make a change (e.g. add a sample or feature) that doesn't have a corresponding issue in the issue tracker, please create one.
3. **Submitting**: When you are ready to submit, send us a Pull Request!

## Writing Code ##

If your contribution contains code, please make sure that it follows [the style guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml), otherwise we will have to ask you to make changes, and that's no fun for anyone.

## Formatting HTML ##

To simplify PR reviews, please word-wrap HTML files at 80 characters or less.
