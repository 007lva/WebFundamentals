<p class="intro">
Push messaging allows developers to engage users by providing timely and customized content outside the context of the web page. <em>Push</em> and <em>Notification</em> are different, but complementary, functions: a <em>push</em> is the action of the server supplying message information to a service worker; a <em>notification</em> is the action of the service worker sending the information to a user.</p>

The W3C manages the specifications for the [Push API](http://www.w3.org/TR/push-api/) and the [Notifications API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/notifications/raw-file/tip/Overview.html).
