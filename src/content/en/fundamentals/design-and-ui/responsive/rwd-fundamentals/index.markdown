There is a multitude of different screen sizes across phones, "phablets",
tablets, desktops, game consoles, TVs, even wearables.  Screen sizes will always
be changing, so it's important that your site can adapt to any screen size,
today or in the future.

Responsive web design, originally defined by [Ethan Marcotte in A List
Apart](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/) responds to the
needs of the users and the devices they're using.  The layout changes based on
the size and capabilities of the device.  For example, on a phone, users would
see content shown in a single column view; a tablet might show the same content
in two columns.
