## Capitalization and naming

### Article & website section titles

  * Title case capitalization
  * Should start with "ing" verb
  * Good: "Handling User Input Across Devices"
  * Bad: "Input handling"
  * For hyphenated words, capitalize as if the hyphens weren't there, e.g. "Multi-Device" and "Peer-to-Peer"

### Headlines within articles
  * Sentence case for headlines in articles: "Use placeholders for images"

## Linking to external articles
  * Related reading to our articles: Add them in 
  * Related reading to external: Use only when necessary

## "Mobile" vs. "multi-device" vs "multi-screen" vs "mobile-only" vs "mobile-first"
  * Use "multi-device" for consistency except when a different term is needed for precision

## Article length
  * _need content here_

## Tone of voice
  * Active, rather than passive.
  * Informal pronouns and abbreviations, when it simplifies text, but don't over-use.
  * Avoid unnecessary adjectives.

## Key takeaways / TL;DR
  * _need content here_

## Media
  * All images need to be in 3:5 or 5:3 ratio
  * Images will be compressed for you during the deploymentt step.  You do not need to worry about compressing your own images.
