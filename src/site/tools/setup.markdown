title: "Set Up Your Dev Environment"
description: "Set up your development environment and quickly get up and running with the Web Starter Kit."
introduction: "Follow the instructions in this guide and you will have the basic foundation your project needs to be responsive and performance across devices."
key-takeaways:
  starter-kit:
    - Decide how much UX you want to inherit from the Web Starter Kit: a responsive layout or just a very basic boilerplate?
    - The Web Starter Kit tools are optional, but if you don't have a solution yet to optimize your site, use them.
notes:
  command-line: 
    - Most of your interactions with the Google Web Starter Kit will be through the command line. Run commands in the Terminal app if youâ€™re on Mac, your shell in Linux, or <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin if you are on Windows</a>.

## Install prerequisites

Before installing the Google Web Starter Kit,
you will need the following:

* NodeJS v?
* npm v?(which comes bundles with Node)

{% include modules/remember.liquid title="Note" list=page.notes.command-line %}

You can check if you have Node and npm installed by typing:

$ node --version && npm --version

If you are using the kit tooling,
install the dependencies needed:

npm install

## Create your project folder

mkdir my-responsive-project

## Clone repository

You can use Web Starter Kit just by cloning the repository and buildingon what we include in the `app` directory:

git clone git://github.com/yeoman/web-starter-kit.git

## Check out starter files 

You will want to checkout `index.html` (the default starting point, slide-out menu),'alt-layout.html' (if you prefer a horizontal nav) or `basic.html` (no layout).

## Install tooling dependencies

If you are using the optional tooling,
install the dependencies needed:

npm install

If you see permission or access errors,
prepend sudo to the above command:

sudo npm install

## Build the project

Build the current project:

gulp

## Review the build output

Open up the 'blah' directory and take a look at your project files:

TBD.

TODO: Can you open index.html or basic.html in local staged version?
TODO: How do the project files differ based on path taken (index, basic,
and/or tooling install)?
