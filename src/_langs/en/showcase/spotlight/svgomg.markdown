introduction: "A beautiful, material responsive frontend for SVGO."
pros: |
  Built by our own [Jake Archibald](http://jakearchibald.com/), SVGOMG is an almost perfect example of a fully responsive and capable tool written with web technologies. It features a beautiful Material Design look, and the transitions are smooth on mobile.
cons: |
  The only real nitpick we'd have to offer is that the initial UX is confusing due to the main UI missing. Other than that, job well done!
