events. With limited sale periods—usually 48 hours—the company couldn’t rely solely on 
customers checking their email to generate sales. Beyond the Rack’s new push notifications 
provided a **20%** click through rate which worked perfectly for flash sales alerts. The 
notifications also provided Beyond the Rack with another touchpoint to interact with a 
highly-engaged and commercially-valuable audience.

time on the site per visit and shopped more often than the average visitor. By creating 
timely pushes, Beyond the Rack increased the relevance and excitement of their pushes &mdash; and 
customers showed their love through higher sales.
