## Available platforms

Choose the ads platform best for your site.
Most websites use the
[Google AdSense platform](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9712?hl=en&ref_topic=1319753&rd=1);
it's free and available to all websites.
The <a href="http://www.google.com/doubleclick/publishers/solutions/">DoubleClick platform</a>
is an ad management platform for large sites with advertising teams.

### Adsense

Google Adsense integrates with Google ads, targeting ads specific to your site content.
The platform also comes with these tools:

* <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/160374?hl=en&ref_topic=1307421">Customization tools</a> to change the look and feel of your ads.
* <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/2973289?hl=en&ref_topic=2717009">Performance tools</a> to monitor and optimize your ad performance.
* <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/2569265?hl=en&ref_topic=1727160">Payment tools</a> to manage ad payments.

The simplest way to use Google Adsense is to create
<a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3213689?hl=en">responsive ad units</a>.
When you use responsive ad units,
the AdSense crawler is intelligent enough to detect which device
a user is on and adjust an ad to fit that device accordingly.
Learn more about how to use responsive ad units in
[Include Ads in Your Site]({{site.baseurl}}/monetization/ad-monetization/include_ads.html).

### DoubleClick

The DoubleClick platform helps publishers sell, schedule, deliver,
and measure all of their ad inventory.
There's two tiers to the platform:
<a href="http://www.google.com/doubleclick/publishers/solutions/ad-serving.html">Double-click for Publishers (DFP)</a>
and <a href="http://www.google.com/doubleclick/publishers/solutions/yield-management.html">DoubleClick Ad Exchange</a>.
<a href="rms/publishergeneral/#utm_medium=et&utm_campaign=en&utm_source=ww-ww-et-nelson_doubleclick">Contact DoubleClick sales</a>
to get started with DFP or Ad Exchange.

#### DoubleClick for Publishers

DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP) allows publishers who have direct relationships
with advertisers to reserve their inventory but also the flexibility to integrate
with other auction-based services (like AdSense or Ad Exchange).

Similar to Google Adsense,
DFP lets you create responsive ad units using the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-gpt/reference?rd=1">Google Publisher Tag (GPT) API</a>,
an ad tagging library for DFP that can dynamically build ad requests.
GPT takes key details such as ad unit name, ad size, and custom targeting,
builds the request, and displays the ad on web pages.
See <a href="https://support.google.com/dfp_premium/answer/3423562?hl=en">Double-click's Building responsive ads</a> to learn how to use this API.

#### DoubleClick Ad Exchange

DoubleClick Ad Exchange is an invite only product
that provides publishers detailed and finely-tuned controls for advertising savvy organizations.

Though Ad Exchange currently doesnâ€™t offer a responsive ad tag,
developers can integrate with DoubleClick for Publishers and
then run Ad Exchange through the GPT API.

## How ads look

You've seen ads and know what they look like.
But you may not yet be aware of how much of an ad's appearance is controlled
by the advertiser versus how much control you have over how ads look on your site.

How ads look depends ad size, ad placement, the type of ad content delivered,
and how ad content is styled.
The following table describes the attributes that control an ad's appearance
(learn more in
[Customize Your Ads]({{site.baseurl}}/monetization/ad-monetization/customize_ads.html)).

<table class="table-2">
  <thead>
    <tr>

    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td data-th="Attribute">
        <strong>Placement:</strong><br> You have full control over where ads are placed on your site. Place ads where they are visible, but don't detract from the main user experience. Here are some common examples of where to place (and size) ads based on how the content is laid out on mobile (see also these <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1282097?hl=en&ref_topic=1307438">best practices for ads placement</a>).

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td data-th="Attribute">
        <strong>Size:</strong><br> You have full control over how ads are sized; however, we recommend using responsive ads. Responsive ads are automatically sized based on the user's device.

      <td data-th="Attribute">

    <tr>
      <td data-th="Attribute">
        <strong>Content style:</strong><br> You have full control over the color, font, and font-sizing for text ads. Choose styles that match or contrast the styles on your site. For example, you can change the color of URL text so that users see clearly where the link will take them.

      <td data-th="Example">

## How ads are targeted

Google AdSense automatically targets ads most relevant
to the content user's are looking for when they go to your site
using the following markers:

* Content and language: users will see ads that match your site's content and language.
* Placement: advertisers can target sites that have ad units placed where they want their ads to appear, and matched to the size they want their ads to be displayed in on targeted devices.
* User's interest: your website and advertisers can target specific user groups, for example, sports enthusiasts.

Ads are targeted based on overall site content, not keywords or categories.

## How the ad auction works

The ad auction determines which ads will appear on your pages
and how much you'll earn from those ads.
Google places relevant
[cost-per-click (CPC)](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/32725)
and [cost-per-thousand-impressions (CPM)](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/18196).
ads in the same auction and lets them compete against one another.
The auction takes place instantaneously and when it's over,
the system automatically picks the advertisers who are willing to pay the most.

Certain ad sizes have more auction pressure than others
When advertisers build advertisements,
they typically make them common sizes (i.e. 300px by 250px).
As it relates to your site, the more popular a size is with advertisers,
the greater the competition will be for ad inventory/placements on your site.
The higher the competition, or â€˜auction pressureâ€™,
the more the advertiser will pay to be viewed and clicked on your site.

The Google Adsense help center explains how the ad auction works in detail
using a simple example (see [Google AdSense program policies](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/160525?hl=en&ref_topic=1628432)).
