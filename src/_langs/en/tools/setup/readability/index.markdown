{% wrap content %}

Don't minify your source files. Keep your source code as readable as possible. Use server-side or build processes to automatically compress your code.

Make your JavaScript pretty. Use source maps to debug readable code,
even when that code is being served minified and compressed.

{% endwrap %}
