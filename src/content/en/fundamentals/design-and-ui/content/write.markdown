The US government writing guide at <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/writing-for-the-web.html">usability.gov</a> summarizes what people want from writing on the web:

> When writing for the web, using plain language allows users to find what they need, understand what they have found, and then use it to meet their needs.
>
> It should also be actionable, findable, and shareable.


## How people read on the web

Research shows that [people don't read web pages, they scan](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/concise-scannable-and-objective-how-to-write-for-the-web/). On average, [people only read 20–28% of web page content](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/). Reading from screens is much slower than reading from paper. People will give up and leave your site unless information is easy to access and understand.

## How to write for the web

Focus on the subject at hand and tell the story upfront. For writing to work across a range of devices and viewports, make sure to get your main points across at the start: as a rule, ideally [in the first four paragraphs, in around 70 words](http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/journalism/article/art20130702112133610).

Ask yourself what people want from your site. Are they trying to find something out? If people visit your site for information, make sure that all your text is oriented to helping them achieve their goal.

Publish only what your visitors want, and nothing more.

[UK government research](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk) also shows that:

> • 80% of people preferred sentences written in clear English — and the more complex the issue, the greater that preference (e.g., 97% preferred "among other things" over the Latin "inter alia").
>
> • The more educated the person and the more specialist their knowledge, the greater their preference for plain English.

In other words: prefer plain English, shorter words and simple sentence structures — even for a literate, technical audience.

## The next billion users

The pared-down approach to writing is particularly important for readers on mobile devices, and is crucial when creating content for low-cost phones with small viewports that require more scrolling and may have lower quality displays and less responsive screens. A minimalist attitude will also make your content easier to localize and internationalize.

Most of the next billion users coming online will have cheap devices, will not want to spend their data plans on navigating long-winded content, and may not be reading in their first language.

The bottom line:

* Keep it simple
* Reduce clutter
* Get to the point
