Borrow an easy sentence from Paul Lewis' runtime performance checklist blog?

We recommend learning as much as you can about rendering optimization. If you are completely unfamiliar with rendering performance in general, try Udacity's [Browser Rendering Optimization course](https://www.udacity.com/course/browser-rendering-optimization--ud860). Need a refresher? Check out the [Rendering Performance fundamentals](fundamentals/performance/rendering/index)
