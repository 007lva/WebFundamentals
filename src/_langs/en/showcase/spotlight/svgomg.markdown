<h3>What we like</h3>

<p>Built by our own <a href="http://jakearchibald.com/">Jake Archibald</a>, SVGOMG is an almost perfect example of a fully responsive and capable tool written with web technologies. It features a beautiful Material Design look, and the transitions are smooth on mobile.</p>

<h3>Possible improvements</h3>

<p>SVGO is really a tool that is predestined to be installed, but it's missing the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/{{page.related[0].href}}">manifest</a>. In addition, the initial UX is confusing due to the main UI missing.</p>
