TBD. This is all about remote-debugging and needs to cleary define the main tasks that remote debugging allow a developer to do: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging 

TBD. For sure, the sections in this page will be extended as content is migrated over. Some task-based headings have been added though to make sure we drive essential tasks nicely.

TBD. Also cover content from https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/tools/devices/device?hl=en with the section on Device Anywhere here: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/tools/devices/cloud?hl=en#device-anywhere

TBD. What to do with webview content? Mostly we need to make sure Android docs cover webview content! We should cover this in-line with remote debugging in the simplest fashion with a link to Android docs. Android docs need to be the go-to destination for webview content: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging#debugging-webviews 

## How to debug websites in browser tabs on your device

TBD. This will cover remote debugging essentials, set up, etc.

## What to Do When Development Site and Device Are on Different Networks

TBD. Run a local web server and use port forwarding or virtual host mapping to access localhostsite on your device: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging#port-forwarding 

## Screencast From Device to Development Machine

TBD. This covers https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging#screencasting
