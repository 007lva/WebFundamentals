You can't use the same developer workflow for desktop-only and expect
to slightly modify it for the multi-device web.

There's a lot more than just three, but for sure, you need to take
these three things into account when deciding on your developer workflow:

* Performance and style must be considered at all stages in your workflow.
* You should choose scaffolding or boilerplate built with multi-device in mind.
* Choose tools that make it easy to debug, build, and test across lots of form factors.
