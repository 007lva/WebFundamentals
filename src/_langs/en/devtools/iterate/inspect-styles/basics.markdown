TBD. There's a working draft in progress as a Google doc for this (dgash@google.com is the owner).

TBD. This page is a much simpler version of the content in this doc: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/dom-and-styles  and this doc: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/elements-styles

## How to select elements on a page

TBD. Instead of covering keyboard short-cuts in this doc, call out to a keyboard reference doc that will cover the keyboard short-cuts. We can start off by referencing the Keyboard short-cuts existing doc (making sure everything is covered). And then create a proper reference card for DevTools in web/tools. Iâ€™m hoping we have time to create a reference card though.

## How to see which styles are applied to an element

TBD. Make sure to cover how to determine which CSS rules are inherited from where: Styles pane docs. Cover CSS preprocessor as well as plain CSS.

## How to tweak styles

TBD. Remember there are separate docs off of this on testing responsive layout and editing styles, also related to Elements panel. This is a high-level starting point.
